## Forensics

- [x] [Deadly Arthropod](./forensics/deadly_arthropod/) - Our operatives have intercepted critical information. Origin? Classified. Objective: Retrieve the flag!
- [X] [Alien Cradle](./forensics/alien_cradles/) - In an attempt for the aliens to find more information about the relic, they launched an attack targeting Pandora's close friends and partners that may know any secret information about it. During a recent incident believed to be operated by them, Pandora located a weird PowerShell script from the event logs, otherwise called PowerShell cradle. These scripts are usually used to download and execute the next stage of the attack. However, it seems obfuscated, and Pandora cannot understand it. Can you help her deobfuscate it?
- [X] [Event Horizon](./forensics/event_horizon/) - Our CEO's computer was compromised in a phishing attack. The attackers took care to clear the PowerShell logs, so we don't know what they executed. Can you help us?
- [X] [Extraterrestrial Persistence](./forensics/extraterrestrial_persistence/) - There is a rumor that aliens have developed a persistence mechanism that is impossible to detect. After investigating her recently compromised Linux server, Pandora found a possible sample of this mechanism. Can you analyze it and find out how they install their persistence?
- [X] [Marshal in the Middle](./forensics/marshal_in_the_middle/) - The security team was alerted to suspicous network activity from a production web server. Can you determine if any data was stolen and what it was?

## Reverse

- [x] [Snakecode](./reverse/snakecode/) - easy - We found this ancient text inscribed on a stone tablet. We believe it describes the history and technology of a mighty but extinct civilization, but we can't be certain as it's written in a dead language. Can you use your specialist knowledge to uncover the truth, and recover their technology?

- [x] [ChromeMiner](./reverse/chromeminer/) - easy - Discurd has filed a DMCA violation regarding a popular browser extension claiming to be conducting VIP giveaways on the company's product. The addon store has since taken down the extension to prevent any potential browser cryptomining malware from being distributed in the marketplace. Could you investigate what the 'Discurd Nitro Giveaway' addon does exactly?

- [x] [Ouija](./reverse/ouija/) - easy - You've made contact with a spirit from beyond the grave! Unfortunately, they speak in an ancient tongue of flags, so you can't understand a word. You've enlisted a medium who can translate it, but they like to take their time...

- [x] [Secured Transfer](./reverse/secured_transfer/) - easy - Ghosts have been sending messages to each other through the aether, but we can't understand a word of it! Can you understand their riddles?

- [x] [Potion Master](./reverse/potion_master/) - easy - After adding the curried eel, your potion is almost complete, your cauldron boiling over. All you need to do now is incant the final spell to finish your masterwork!

- [X] [Hunting License](./reverse/hunting_license) - easy - STOP! Adventurer, have you got an up to date relic hunting license? If you don't, you'll need to take the exam again before you'll be allowed passage into the spacelanes!

- [X] [Shattered Tablet](./reverse/shattered_tablet) - easy - Deep in an ancient tomb, you've discovered a stone tablet with secret information on the locations of other relics. However, while dodging a poison dart, it slipped from your hands and shattered into hundreds of pieces. Can you reassemble it and read the clues?

- [] [Pseudo](./reverse/pseudo/) - medium - Do you have enough permissions to get the flag?

- [] [The Vault](./reverse/the_vault/) - medium - After following a series of tips, you have arrived at your destination; a giant vault door. Water drips and steam hisses from the locking mechanism, as you examine the small display - 'PLEASE SUPPLY PASSWORD'. Below, a typewriter for you to input. You must study the mechanism hard - you might only have one shot...

- [] [Malception](./reverse/malception/) - medium - Attackers have infiltrated our domain and poisoned DNS records to infect users with a ransomware. We weren't able to retrieve any artifacts, but we have a packet capture you could use.

- [] [Indefinite](./reverse/indefinite/) - medium - You hold in one hand an encrypted datastream, and in the other the central core of a Golden Fang communications terminal. Countless spies have risked their lives to steal both the encrypted attack plans, and the technology used to conceal it, and bring them to you for expert analysis. To your horror, as you turn the screws on the core, its defense mechanisms spring to life, concealing and covering its workings. You have minutes to spare before the device destroys itself - can you crack the code?

- [] [Mr. Abilgate](./reverse/mr_abilgate/) - medium - Mr. Abilgate, the CFO of a Fortune 500 company, has reportedly been the victim of a recent spree of ransomware attacks. The behavior of the malware seems consistent with our current APT target's tactics, but the ransom note makes us think it's a targeted attack. We suspect bad faith from corporate espionage gone wrong. Could you investigate?

- [] [Curse Breaker](./reverse/curse_breaker/) - medium - A dark wizard placed a curse on you - if you open your mouth to say anything, it'll strike! Only by perfectly reciting the counter-spell can you escape...

- [] [Pneumatic Validator](./reverse/pneumatic_validator/) - hard - In some alternate reality, computers are not electronics-based but instead use air pressure. No electrons are zipping by and instead, a large pneumatic circuit takes care of all the math. In that world, we reverse engineers are not staring countless hours into debuggers and disassemblers but are inspecting the circuits on a valve level, trying to figure out how the particles will behave in weird components and how they are connected. Thinking about it, that doesn't sound too different, does it?

- [] [Freaky Forum Interception](./reverse/freaky_forum_interception/) - hard - You've arrived on the planet Drion-1, where the high galactic court is based. You've come to spread the word about the dangers of Draeger, and gather support, but thousands upon thousands of other lifeforms are also here to argue, squabble and dispute, speaking a thousand different languages. Can you make yourself heard above the babble?

- [] [Shuffleme](./reverse/shuffleme/) - hard - Intelligence indicates that the ancient data storage device you've obtained contains schematics for a never-before-seen weapon. But there's a problem - it's locked, and strange symbiotic lifeforms on its surface are constantly removing parts and reinserting them elsewhere. Can you get a clear picture of what's going on?

- [] [Convoluted Boot](./reverse/convoluted_boot/) - hard - Some nodes in our data center have been producing unexpected errors and crash for a while now. When analyzing the systems offline, we couldn't find anything wrong with them. After a very throurough investigation, we think we have it nailed down to the netboot server handling the distributions on the PXE network, we suspect a bootkit is involved. Can you figure out what is happening?

- [] [Spell Weaving Exam](./reverse/spell_weaving_exam/) - hard - Turn your spellbooks over now - the final exam has begun! Under the watchful eye of a strict adjuducator, you must answer each question perfectly

## Mobile

- [x] [APKrypt](./mobile/apkrypt/) - Can you get the ticket without the VIP code?
